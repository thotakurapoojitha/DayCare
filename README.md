🏥Hospital Day Care React App
📌 Project Overview:
A web app made with React responds well on Day Care screens. It adjusts smoothly when you change device size.

Managing doctors and patients becomes possible through the app, while backend systems connect behind the scenes. Real-time information flows in straight from the server, thanks to built-in communication paths. Features work together without extra steps, keeping tasks smooth even during updates.

A fresh take on learning began with building something real. Not just theory, but how pieces fit together across client and server. Through doing, ideas became clearer. One step at a time, the connections took shape without relying on pre-built shortcuts. Understanding grew by working through each part slowly. The goal wasn’t speed - it was seeing how things truly link up from start to finish.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
